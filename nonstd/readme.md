# `dbj::nanolib::nonstd`

`dbj_memaligned.h` and `dbj_nanostring.h` are not in use currently.

#### types in here, have the reason of existence if they do 

- not use exceptions
- not use iostreams
- expand functionality on top of sane requirements
  - for example
    - default constructor for reference_wrapper -- dbj++ref_wrap.h_
    - more compile time goodies like dbj++ct.h
